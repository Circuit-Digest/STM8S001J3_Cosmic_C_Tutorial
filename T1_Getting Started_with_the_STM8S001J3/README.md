This tutorial is going to be very exciting for you because in the end of this tutorial you will be able to program a new microcontroller. I am always being curious to try new kind of development boards and microcontrollers. If you are a regular reader on our website, then you might have seen our previous tutorial series on STM8S103F3P6 development board. Now we are going to try an another microcontroller IC from the STM8 family that is STM8S001J3. But this microcontroller comes in a SMD-SO8N package. So, we need to make a PCB for this IC. At first we are going to design and manufacture our custom PCB to mount the STM8S001J3 IC. Then we will see how to program the STM8S001J3 IC. Letâ€™s know about the STM8S001J3 IC before design the PCB for it.
